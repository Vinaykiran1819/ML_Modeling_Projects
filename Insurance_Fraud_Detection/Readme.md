## Overview
In this project, I developed a robust fraud detection system for first-party physical damage claims within the insurance sector, focusing on claims from 2015 to 2016. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, I significantly improved detection metrics, achieving a 70% F1 score and a 60% accuracyâ€”up from a baseline of 40%. This enhancement in fraud detection not only led to substantial cost savings but also increased customer trust by accurately identifying and preventing fraudulent claims.
