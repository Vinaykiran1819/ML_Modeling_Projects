### Overview
This project utilized a comprehensive dataset from 130 U.S. hospitals spanning 1999 to 2008 to develop a predictive model for early readmission among diabetes patients. By analyzing over 100,000 patient records, we aimed to enhance diabetes care efficiency and reduce healthcare costs. The model we developed demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, achieving a sensitivity of 70.85% and a specificity of 91%, with an AUC of 0.7. This translates to a significant improvement, marking a 250% increase in model performance from the baseline. Moreover, the model's predictive strength allowed for an estimated $28.16 million in healthcare savings, showcasing its substantial potential to cut costs while improving patient care outcomes.
