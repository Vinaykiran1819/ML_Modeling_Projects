## Overview 
This project harnesses the power of PySpark to predict fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices, achieving an accuracy rate of 76.2%. A sophisticated machine learning pipeline was created and implemented, incorporating advanced techniques such as grid search, permutation importance analysis, and model stacking. These methods were crucial in fine-tuning the hyperparameters and optimizing the model's performance. The project marked a notable improvement in accuracy, achieving an AUC score of 0.77, with the F1 score rising to 68.28% and precision reaching 76.2%, reflecting a 25% increase from the baseline. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented strategies in predicting price movements in the cryptocurrency market.
